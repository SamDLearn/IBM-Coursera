1.Consider the following linear regression model.
y = b + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4
What answers are true?

x1 - x4 are used to predict y
w1 - w4 are used to predict y


2.Consider the following linear regression model.
y = b + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4

What is the dimensionality of the training data set?
4

3.Consider the following linear regression model.
y = b + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4
Now consider that the influence of x3 to predict y is very low. On other words, independently of the value of x3, y doesn't change a lot, therefore x3 and y are weakly correlated.
Please choose a value for w3 to reflect this behaviour
