1. What is to coordinate of this data point in vector notation?
(2,3)

2. What is to coordinate of this data point in vector notation?
(1,2,3)

3. Consider the following plot with two data points and a plane separating those points. This is a process which is called binary classification which will be covered in the next course.
(..,..,1.5)

4.Given the following plot you can clearly see that there are two clusters.
(1.5,1.5,1.5) (2.1,1.9,2.2) (1,1,1)

5. What is the correlation between the two lists?

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

7,6,5,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

0.709

6. What is the covariance between the two lists?

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

7,6,5,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

3.65

7. The correlation between the following two lists is zero, can you explain why?

1,2,3,4,5,6,7

7,6,5,4,5,6,7


Correlation of 1st half of the list is negative and between the last half of the list is positive so they cancel out


8. Please select all data with potentially high correlation

Outside Temprature + Power Consumption of AC

Crop fitness + Amount of water available

Season of Year+Amount of Rain
