6.What is the advantage of using ApacheSparkSQL over RDDs? (select all that apply)
Answer: 


Catalyst and Tungsten are able to optimise the execution, so are more likely to execute more quickly than if you would had implemented something equivalent using the RDD API.

The API is simpler and doesn't require specific functional programming skills
