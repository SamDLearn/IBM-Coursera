5. What is the difference between Cell State and Hidden State?
Answer: LSTM cell state.... and LSTM Hiddwn state..... are correct

6. Given is the formula to compute the number of LSTM layer parameters:
PARAMETERS = 4 * LSTM outputs size * (weights LSTM inputs size + weights LSTM outputs size + 1 bias variable)

Please, calculate the parameters for the Layer with the output-shape (64, 30, 10). This the first layer after the input-layer, which has the shape (64, 30, 1).

Select single correct answer:

Answer:  480
